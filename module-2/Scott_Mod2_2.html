        <p class="intro">My Name is Jackie Scott. I was born in Houston, Texas. I have lived in Houston majority of my life. 
            I spent a great deal of my childhood living in Mexico. Spanish is my first language and I did not learn to speak English until the age of nine.

            Prior to me working in the IT industry, I went to Culinary school.<span class="sentence">My culinary training had a focus on French pastries.</span>
        Sometimes I miss working in a kitchen but then I remember the long hours and suddenly baking at home sounds just as fun.
        I mostly only bake for fun or special events. My grandpa was a baker his whole life and even owned his own bakery until he retired.

        I am a very craft person by nature. I am a self taught sewist. I also taught myself how to use a computerized embroidery machine. 
        I also taught myself how to create embroidery designs by digitizing images. I felt that my embroider hobby really brought together my
        love for technology and crafting.

            I took an interest in the world of technology thanks to my husband. I would watch him do his homework and found it very interesting. I have an AAS in Networking. 
            I have never actually worked as a network admin due to the fact that I did not find it as interesting as virtual packet tracer that I did in school. I am now a ITSM Admin. I have worked in several ticketing systems.
            This lead me down my current path of learning how to become a software developer.
